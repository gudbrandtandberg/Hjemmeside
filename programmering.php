<p>Below you will find a handful of projects I have worked on during the last few years.</p>

<h3>Solar System I</h3>
<p>
	I used to really love solving the solar system. It's very pleasing, how it all comes together; physics model, mathematical model, solution theory, visualization.. I've learned a lot from this. My first program was written in matlab, and used a simple RK4-solver to solve the solar system for one period of the largest planet in the input. The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/gudbrandtandberg/SolarSystem">here</a>.

<h3>Solar System II</h3>
<p>
	Soon after finishing my first solar system project, I had the opportunity to do it all again, better, faster, stronger, for a computational physics course I was taking at school. This time, I wrote the program in C++. I solved the same system of equations as in the previous version, except this time I wrote a adaptive block-timestep solver, and used OpenMP to parallelize the program. Finally, I got my first peek at 3D-graphics using OpenGL to visualize the results. Lot's of fun! <a href="https://github.com/gudbrandtandberg/N-Body">Here's</a> the project.

<h3>Stegosaur</h3>

<p>
I find image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">stegenography</a> to be a fascinating concept! I wrote a steganography program last year, while stranded on a paradise island in Malaysia with a broken leg. It takes as input an image and a message and 'hides' the message in the sequence of least significant bits of the image. <a href="https://github.com/gudbrandtandberg/Stegosaur">Github link</a>.

<h3>Travelblog</h3>

<p>
	Most of last year I spent traveling through South East Asia with my darling. We wrote this blog for our family and friends at home to enjoy. We wrote everything ourselves from scratch using html, css, php and javascript. It wasn't easy to keep up the website, especially from the more remote places, but we did it.

<h3>Hilde's Website</h3>

<p>
	My aunt is an artist specializing in personalized paintings of family pets. This is the website I made for her.

<h3>Weekday Veggie</h3>

<p>
	This was my first attempt at making an iOS app. 'HverdagsVeggis'&mdash;Weekday Veggie in English, is a collection of vegetarian recipes, created and presented by me. The final product is quite so-so, but I learnt a lot from the experience. I spent hundreds of hours on it, learning Objective-C, getting into XCode, app-development, etc. In the end, I made it to the App Store, where I have earned a small handful of dollars :)

<h3>Braingames</h3>
<p>
For my second iOS app project I started to make a few very simple games. The result was an app on the App Store.

<h3>Raspberry Pi Alarm Clock</h3>
<p>
The Raspberry Pi is such a cool little device. I ordered one as soon the first version hit the shelves. Through many iterations of trial-and-error, I ended up with a very cool alarm clock. The clock is operated using three buttons and gives feedback using LED-lights. At the preprogrammed time of awakening, the computer chooses a random song from a list of songs that I like waking up to. Always wake up smiling with this little thing.

<h3>A History of Number Theory</h3>

<p>
	I love history. And I love number theory. So when I had a whole term to work on any math-related project I fancied, I quickly chose to write a paper following the history of number theory. I trace the history of number theory through surveying a number of results of Euclid, Diophantus, Fermat, Euler and Gauss.

<h3>Scratch</h3>
<p>
Scratch is a really neat programming language! I have held several courses in Scratch-programming for children, and I love seeing how quickly and naturally they take to it. Thanks to the folks at MIT for creating it! Check out the Scratch website, make a profile and have fun! This is <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/gubbisduff">my profile</a>.
